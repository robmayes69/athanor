"""
Command handler

This module contains the infrastructure for accepting commands on the
command line. The processing of a command works as follows:

1. The calling object (caller) is analyzed based on its callertype.
2. Cmdsets are gathered from different sources:
   - chans:  all available channel names are auto-created into a cmdset, to allow
     for giving the channel name and have the following immediately
     sent to the channel. The sending is performed by the CMD_CHANNEL
     system command.
   - object cmdsets: all objdb at caller's location are scanned for non-empty
     cmdsets. This includes cmdsets on exits.
   - caller: the caller is searched for its own currently active cmdset.
   - account: lastly the cmdsets defined on caller.account are added.
3. The collected cmdsets are merged together to a combined, current cmdset.
4. If the input string is empty -> check for CMD_NOINPUT command in
   current cmdset or fallback to error message. Exit.
5. The Command Parser is triggered, using the current cmdset to analyze the
   input string for possible command matches.
6. If multiple matches are found -> check for CMD_MULTIMATCH in current
   cmdset, or fallback to error message. Exit.
7. If no match was found -> check for CMD_NOMATCH in current cmdset or
   fallback to error message. Exit.
8. A single match was found. If this is a channel-command (i.e. the
   ommand name is that of a channel), --> check for CMD_CHANNEL in
   current cmdset or use channelhandler default. Exit.
9. At this point we have found a normal command. We assign useful variables to it that
   will be available to the command coder at run-time.
12. We have a unique cmdobject, primed for use. Call all hooks:
   `at_pre_cmd()`, `cmdobj.parse()`, `cmdobj.func()` and finally `at_post_cmd()`.
13. Return deferred that will fire with the return from `cmdobj.func()` (unused by default).

                command was called. which this was called from.  What this is
                depends on the game state.
            cmdobjects (dict): The Keys are string-names of the 'object types' of all
                the objdb that should have their CmdSets retrieved. the Value is the objdb
                themselves. example {'session': <obj>, 'account': <account>}
            raw_string (str): The command string as given on the command line.
            _testing (bool, optional): Used for debug purposes and decides if we
                should actually execute the command or not. If True, the
                command instance will be returned.
            session (Connection, optional): Relevant if callertype is "account" - the session will help
                retrieve the correct cmdsets from puppeted objdb.
            cmdobj (Command, optional): If given a command instance, this will be executed using
                `called_by` as the caller, `raw_string` representing its arguments and (optionally)
                `cmdobj_key` as its input command name. No cmdset lookup will be performed but
                all other options apply as normal. This allows for running a specific Command
                within the command system mechanism.
            cmdobj_key (string, optional): Used together with `cmdobj` keyword to specify
                which cmdname should be assigned when calling the specified Command instance. This
                is made available as `self.cmdstring` when the Command runs.
                If not given, the command will be assumed to be called as `cmdobj.key`.

        Kwargs:
            kwargs (any): other keyword arguments will be assigned as named variables on the
                retrieved command object *before* it is executed. This is unused
                in default Evennia but may be used by code to set custom flags or
                special operating conditions for a command as it executes.
